# stenciler
a holder for stencils to use for solder paste application

# usage
Using two bases cut from 3mm MDF (to mitigate non vertical kerf) and 1.5~1.6mm acrylic as a spacer. Pins are cut from 6mm steel axle, but probably can be found already cut to size.

# files
There are few .ai files for laser cutting and their dxf sources as well as the original Autodesk Inventor files. Inventor files are parametrised (see base.ipt)
About .15mm clearance compared to nominal stencil size seems fine, iterated between 0 and .5mm.
