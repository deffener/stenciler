# usage
Using two bases cut from 3mm MDF (to mitigate non vertical kerf) and 1.5~1.6mm acrylic as a spacer. Pins are cut from 6mm steel axle, but probably can be found already cut to size.

Spacers from 1.5mm acrylic can be used to support the stencil and a middle cross can be used to align a pocket cut from 1.5mm acrylic (pcb-holder for my specific usage)

# files
There are few .ai files for laser cutting and their dxf sources as well as the original Autodesk Inventor files. Inventor files are parametrised (see base.ipt)
About .15mm clearance compared to nominal stencil size seems fine, iterated between 0 and .5mm.
